#### PROJECT FUNCTIONALITIES (For iOS and Android apps):

- You can see the position of your motorcycle at all times.
- You can see the last update date of your motorcycle's position.
- If your motorcycle is moving, speed in meters per second.
- You can activate and deactivate the service via bluetooth.
- You can see the battery status of the device.
- You can activate and deactivate the service through sms from the application.
- If your motorcycle starts to move, you will receive an alert by SMS of the change of position of the motorcycle and the speed.
- You can ask him to send you an SMS or chat to see the status of the battery.
- You can ask for the position of the motorcycle and you will receive an SMS.
- You can also ask how it is and it will send you temperature, humidity and whether it is raining or not ;)

#### PROJECT FUNCTIONALITIES (For macOS app):

- You can see the position of your motorcycle at all times.
- You can see the last update date of your motorcycle's position.
- If your motorcycle is moving, speed in meters per second.
- You can see the battery status of the device.

#### UPDATE TIMES (For iOS and Android apps):

- With the service deactivated, the status of the battery is sent every <b>24 hours</b>.
- With the service activated, if the motorcycle with MPU650 module detects movement, it is sent every <b>2 minutes</b>.
- From the mobile application, you can change the default update time (2 minutes) and adapt it to your needs, but the MPU6050 sensor will activate the services if necessary and save battery ;)

### WHAT IS ARDUINO?

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.

This is the manufacturer's website:

[Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc "Arduino")

To program for Arduino, you need to download the Integrated development environment (IDE):

[Arduino software website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Arduino Software")

### LINKIT ONE BOARD

For this project, I found an Arduino board that integrated all the modules I needed and had a good price: Linkit One.

The LinkIt ONE development board is an open source, high-performance board for prototyping Wearables and IoT devices. It's based on the world's leading SoC for Wearables, MediaTek Aster (MT2502) combined with high-performance Wi-Fi (MT5931) and GPS (MT3332) chipsets to provide you with access to all the features of MediaTek LinkIt. It also provides similar pin-out features to Arduino boards, making it easy for you to connect to various sensors, peripherals, and Arduino shields.

In order to use this board with the Arduino IDE, you need to follow some steps:

### MPU6050

MPU6050 sensor module is an integrated 6-axis Motion tracking device.

It has a 3-axis Gyroscope, 3-axis Accelerometer, Digital Motion Processor and a Temperature sensor, all in a single IC.

It can accept inputs from other sensors like 3-axis magnetometer or pressure sensor using its Auxiliary I2C bus.

If external 3-axis magnetometer is connected, it can provide complete 9-axis Motion Fusion output.

A microcontroller can communicate with this module using I2C communication protocol. Various parameters can be found by reading values from addresses of certain registers using I2C communication.

Gyroscope and accelerometer reading along X, Y and Z axes are available in 2â€™s complement form. Temperature reading is also available in signed integer form.

Gyroscope readings are in degrees per second (dps) unit; Accelerometer readings are in g unit; and Temperature reading is in degrees Celsius.

This module is used to send movement alert by SMS and not consume battery sending data if they are not necessary to the server.

[MPU6050 in 'Amazon' shop](https://www.amazon.es/SODIAL-MPU-6050-giroscopio-Acelerometro-Arduino/dp/B00K67X810/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1525460814&sr=8-4&keywords=mpu6050 "MPU6050")

### INSTRUCTIONS

You have to add a SIM card in your Linkit One with the PIN code deactivated in order to use the GPRS connection, in addition, I use a card with SMS to be able to communicate with the motorcycle, as well as over the Internet, by normal SMS.

I use FreedomPop SIM, it is free with:

- 200 mb for data
- 300 SMS
- 100 minutes for call

[FreedomPop website](https://es.freedompop.com/es?experience=organic.default "FreedomPop")

Once you have everything configured in the Arduino IDE to use your new Linkit One board, you can already clone this repository on your computer and access the MotoAlarmProject folder and open the <b>MotoAlarmProject.ino</b> file.

You need to download and install two libraries that are used in the project in the Arduino IDE:

[ArduinoJson in GitHub](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson "ArduinoJson")

[elapsedMillis in GitHub](https://github.com/pfeerick/elapsedMillis "elapsedMillis")

[MPU6050 in GitHub](https://github.com/jarzebski/Arduino-MPU6050 "MPU6050")

[OTAUpdate in GitHub](https://github.com/ArtCC/OTAUpdate "OTAUpdate")

The only class in which you need to add your data is in the <b>PublicConstants.h</b> class.

![MacDown Screenshot](Resources/ArduinoIDE.png)

Your configuration data is in this class, but you only need to add the following:

- The name of the device to connect by bluetooth with the iOS application. If you do not modify it in the application or in the device code, it will be 'MotoAlarmProject'.

```
// Device name
#define DEVICE_NAME = "MotoAlarmProject";
```

- To configure internet access from your Linkit One with your SIM card, you must add your operator's configuration. In my case, the APN property is 'internetmas' and the username and password are empty.

```
// APN
#define APN_NAME = "apnName";
#define APN_USER = "";
#define APN_PASSWORD = "";
```

- For your Linkit One to send you SMS you have to add your phone in your profile in the iOS or Android application and it will be sent by bluetooth when you activate the service.

You can now upload the code to your Linkit One!

### BOX FOR LINKIT ONE AND BATTERY WITH 6000mAh (Battery size: 19x54x54mm)

If you have a 3D printer or know someone who has it, here are the .stl files to print that I designed for the project:

[Battery in 'BricoGeek' shop](http://tienda.bricogeek.com/baterias-lipo/418-bateria-lipo-6000mah-37v.html)

### INSTALLING IN YOUR MOTORBIKE

I have changed the original battery with 1000mAh for a battery with 6000mAh, so it lasts a lot longer without charging.

I added a usb charger to the battery in my motorcycle but in positive, that means that when I turn off the motorcycle it has no current, it only charges the powerbank when the motorcycle is on.

### DO YOU CAN'T THE DEVICE? ASK FOR MY HELP!
